<table width=600><tr><td valign=top><b>>> Shindou Shuichi - Seiyuu</b><br><br>
<div align="justify"><img src="http://dream.ainoyume.net/info/images/seki.jpg" align=left border=1>Shuichi's seiyuu is the Seki Tomokazu! XDD This is a name that you should recognize if you know anything about seiyuu. He was born in Tokyo on September 8th, and he is currently working for Haikyou. He's done some of the biggest seiyuu roles in anime, including Kinomoto Touya in CardCaptor Sakura, Chichiri and Kouji in Fushigi Yuugi, Van Fanel in Tenkuu no Escaflowne, Hidaka Ken in Weiss Kreuz, Shirou Kamui in X/1999, and Suzuhara Touji and Seele in Neon Genesis Evangelion. In addition, he's also done Alexander Howell from Ayashi no Ceres, Kenji from Pocket Monsters (Pokemon), Daikouji Guy from Martin Successor Nadesico. Some of his voice roles in recent anime include Ogata Masaharu from Angelic Layer, Souma Kyou from Fruits Basket, and Dee Laytner from Fake. Seki's also a member of the Weiss and THTC, composed of the male cast of Weiss Kreuz and Fushigi Yuugi. Seki's not your average seiyuu, he wanted to be an actor, but didn't quite fit the physical complexion of an actor, so he became a seiyuu. He's done some acting though, for the Hero Hero Q Company. He has quite a sex drive and a thing for ecchi girls XD It's known that he lost his virginity at age 17. =P He has a great sense of humor and he's very self-confident. </p>
<p><img src="http://dream.ainoyume.net/info/images/seki0.jpg" align=right border=1>Seki probably ranks as one of my top favorite seiyuu, among Megumi Hayashibara, Fukami Rica, etc. Not only because I've seen most of the anime that he's done voice roles in, but because he's done a great job in each and every one of them. In each anime, his voice is slightly altered from another anime to fit the character exactly. Not all characters he's played are as genki as Shuichi, some are far from it, in fact. Shu-chan is probably the most hyper character Seki's played, except maybe Chichiri from FY. His role as Van Fanel in Escaflowne is wonderful as well, you can't really tell Shuichi and Van are played by the same seiyuu until you hear Shuichi serious. His role as Kamui in X is splendid, you can pretty much hear the resemblance between Kamui and Van, since their personalities are somewhat similar. Ken's voice in Weiss kreuz is a bit more similar to Shuichi's serious voice than Kamui's or Van's. All in all, the resemblance is heard in all of them. Shuichi's voice has never failed to crack me up, even when I've seen the scene 10 times already. I love his idiotic words and laugh when he tries to cheer Yuki up, and when he's cheering "date" at the recording studio, I can't help but laugh. Seki's outdone himself with the genki voice of Shuichi, giving him as much emotion, dispair, and anger as possible so he seems more human. One can love Shuichi just by loving his voice. XD I've always enjoyed his voice acting in various anime, he's one talented seiyuu. :D <br>

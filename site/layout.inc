<b>:: LAYOUT INFORMATION</b><br><br>
You are currently viewing version 7.0 of the High Graphics version of Dare to Dream. Since the debut of version 2.0, the entire High Graphics version of DtD was revamped to have varying layouts for enjoyment. Most of the images were scanned from artbooks or DVD covers, so please do not e-mail me claiming that these images are yours. All graphics were edited in <a href="http://www.jasc.com" target="_blank">Paint Shop Pro 7.02</a>. Some fonts used for titles were Beckett, Belphebe, Bickley Script, Brush Script MT, Castellar, and Freshbot. Most regular text are Helvetica and Verdana. You can find all these fonts and almost any font at <a href="http://www.fontseek.com" target="_blank">Font Seek</a>. No special effects for html, except the dropshadow filter used on some pages. 
<br><br>All layouts are best viewed with 800x600 resolutions using F11, and all layouts should be viewed with 800x600 resolutions or higher, in IE only. I'm not sure how it looks on Netscape, as I haven't gotten the time to try it out yet. I imagine that the Entertainment Centre layout will not look normal in Netscape since it is in frames.<br><br>Please do not take any of the edited graphics for your own usage. If I find out (which I will), I will not be polite to you and severe consequences will result. Thank you for reading and have a lovely day.

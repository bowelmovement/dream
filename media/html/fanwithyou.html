"This is taking longer than usual." Yuki paused again after blowing a puff of cigarette smoke from his lips. It had been two days but, Yuki had finally returned from New York. He was home again. A place where he had first ran away to was now his new life. He was needed, loved, and adored by everyone surrounding him. Plus he had finally faced his past. The memories of his sempai both good and bad would always be with him, but for now the demons had vanished and he could sleep soundly again. Happiness had reached Yuki at last...now that he was by his side. 
<br><br>
"Shuichi",Yuki spoke silently. As much as Yuki hate to admit it, the days seemed to go longer when Shuichi wasn't by his side. Now that Bad Luck had reached a million record sales, a full scale tour was on the way. This would be the last week that Shuichi would be around for two months. Yuki had already promised himself that he would make these last few nights with Shuichi something to remember. A moonlit night and a soft warm bed...all that was missing was him. "Where could you be, Shuichi..."
<br><br>
"I have to be strong." Shuichi stared at the stars wondering what to do with himself. Work had been exhausting over the past two days. Pressure to write lyrics for a second album had begun, interviews and TV spots were appearing out of nowhere and the tour would officially begin next week. Although Shuichi was happy with the status of Bad Luck, he was still missing something...Yuki had still not returned. The house felt so cold without him. Now when night fell, Shuichi dreaded the return home. He thought of spending the night with Hiro but, his free time was mostly spent with Ayaka. Shuichi didn't want to intrude.
<br><br>
It was getting late and their was a lot of work to be done tomorrow. "It will all work out in the end," Shuichi said to himself. He looked around and thought of the first time he saw Yuki. This was the very same park that he stood in now. The very same place he glazed his eyes on the man that he fell in love with. Shuichi stood there and cried silently. "You have zero talent." The first words repeated in his head over and over again. They weren't the loving words that a normal person would say but, then again Yuki was not normal. Those words seemed to give Shuichi strength. Those words would keep him going...even if he wasn't there.
<br><br>
Shuichi opened the door silently. He walked straight to Yuki's room. There it was. The bed that had a become a lake full of memories. So many emotions, so many words spoken, thoughts of past ecstasy drifted in Shuichi's head. It hurt. It hurt to know that he was alone tonight. Placing himself on the bed, he grasped the nearest pillow to him tightly. "Why aren't you here with me Yuki?", Shuichi whispered. "I'm alone again."
<br><br>
"Who said you were alone...baka." Shuichi turned around only to find a shirtless Yuki staring at him. "Yuki," Shuichi stuttered. He was too breathless to talk. Yuki walked towards him and gently placed his hand on Shuichi's cheek. "You're so silly." "Even when you're alone, I'll be there." Shuichi stared back into those cold yet understanding eyes. "I'm with you," Yuki whispered. Shuichi slowly clasped Yuki's hand with his own and placed it on his chest. He was about to speak, when Yuki placed a finger on his lips. They fell towards the bed together. "Even in times of despair," Shuichi thought," I'm never alone."

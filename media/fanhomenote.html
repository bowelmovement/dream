<b>Description:</b> Yuki reflecting on his feelings of Shuiichi at the end of the series. Vignette.<br><br>
<b>Disclaimer/Author's Note:</b> =Ahem!= This is a Gravitation fic. Gravitation is &copy; Maki Murakami. This fic &copy; Me! MUWAH! My ideas, my writing, my brain being spilled at 1:00am in the morning... x_X; geh... At any rate, there will be more. This is, at any rate, my first Gravitation fanfiction. It's a character-centric, thought-centric little vignette. I hope you all enjoy. Last side note. This is Yuki speaking about Shuichi. I'm sure the idea's not original. This text IS as it's MINE! KUWAH! And give me a small break... my reading of Gravi fics is actually very limited... T_T ANYWAY! On with the fic, and enjoy! ^_~<br><br>
<b>Dedication:</b> This fic is DEDICATED! To whom? Well... This is for you, Trin Trin! ^_~ So it's not exactly what you wanted.... gotta love spur of the moment, influenced fics! ^_~;;; <br><br><center><a href="/media" onmouseover="window.status=' >> Entertainment Centre <<'; return true;" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;">Entertainment Centre</a> || <a href="/index.php" target="_blank">X-Clear</a></center></p></td></tr></table>

<b>06.30.2004</b>: Whoo, 3 months later and we're kicking back in gear. I suppose I have the US release of the 1st volume DVD to thank. Therefore, a new layout is plainly seen. I was hoping for a diary/stationary entry sort of layout. Hope everyone likes it. ^_^ Also, if anyone would like to review the 1st DVD on quality, voices, extras, etc., I would be happy to put it in the Essays & Articles section. I'm planning on reviewing it myself as soon as I receive my DVD in the mail. Otherwise, enjoy the update!

<b>03.31.2004</b>: Apologies for the temporary disappearance of DtD. The <a href="http://shounen-ai.org">Shounen-ai orG</a> switched hosts, so I had to move back in. XD All in all, nothing's really changed. I organized the site a lot better behind the scenes, created many folders and sorted out some stuff. On the surface, you shouldn't see any changes. If you do come across a broken image or some other mistake though, feel free to <a href="site/contact.php">contact</a> me. Otherwise, enjoy!

<b>02.23.2004</b>: What's this? Another update in such a short time? It's all because of you, dear visitors (see, you <i>can</i> help increase the updates at DtD). XD This update's all regarding the interactivity here at DtD. Thus, yet another response is added at the <a href="/info/visitors.php">feedbacks</a> section. I'm glad visitors are using the Essays and Articles section to interact, while keeping the responses at a mature level. I hope this continues. :3 Then there's a new Fanart under the <a href="/media">Entertainment</a> centre under Fanworks >> Fanart. Happy surfing!

<b>02.11.2004</b>: New, refreshing version of DtD on the Graphics heavy side, just in time for Valentine's Day! DtD also brings you another addition of <a href="/info/visitors.php">feedbacks</a> for my Essays & Articles. This time, a visitor replies to another visitor's opinions. Lastly, there is now a <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dare_to_dream/">Newsletter</a> mailing list for DtD, so if you want to know when DtD updates without checking back all the time, <a href="mailto:dare_to_dream-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">join</a> this group!

<b>01.19.2004</b>: *sweatdrops profusely* Looks like I might be going into a habit of updating every couple of months instead of every couple of weeks. The important thing is, I'm still updating, ne? XD Anyway, we have a <u>ton</u> of <a href="/info/visitors.php">feedbacks</a> for my Essays & Articles. A big THANK YOU goes out to everyone who kindly spent some time to reply with opinions on the various topics. Everyone's opinions were awesome to read and I hope visitors feel the same way. That would be all in this edition. ^^ Hopefully we'll be expecting a new layout soon, but I'm not making any promises. *ducks flying tomatoes* XD

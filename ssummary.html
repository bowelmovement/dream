<table width=600><tr><td valign=top><b>>> Fujisaki Suguru - Summary</b><p>
<img src="http://dream.ainoyume.net/info/images/sugu.jpg" align=left>Suguru is the third member of the band Bad Luck other than Hiroshi and Shuichi. He is a very talented sixteen year old as well as the synthesizer of the band. Although he's the youngest one of the band by a couple of years, he is nevertheless any less talented than the rest. This may be because he's the cousin of Seguchi Tohma. ^_^ Shuichi was very mad when he found out that Tohma had made a decision to recruit another member for Bad Luck. He thought that Bad Luck could only consist of Hiroshi and him. He wasn't any happier upon hearing Suguru synthesize the Rage Beat, in fact, he was shocked. He was shocked that a sixteen year old could be so talented and could make the Rage Beat seem better with the synthesizing. Suguru was very nice and intended to do his best to live up to the expectations of Tohma.</p>
<p><img src="http://dream.ainoyume.net/info/images/sugu0.jpg" align=right>Suguru is a smart person who has at least some knowledge with producing music. He tolerates and puts up with Shuichi's rapid mood swings (mostly due to Yuki's behavior) but sometimes enough is enough. He is there when Shuichi goes out of control in front of the press, like the time Hiro decided to leave and Shuichi was going to announce his retirement. Shuichi utterly broke loose and said that without Hiro, Bad Luck would not be able to surpass Nittle Grasper, because..."Nittle Grasper has no guitarist!!!!" Suguru grabbed Shuichi by the collar and started to shake him XDD saying "What kind of stupid reason is that? Hiro-san won't come back because of that!" Besides an angry face here and there, Suguru is pretty much always calm and doing what he thinks is best for the band. He's the one that really holds the band together at times.<br><br><u>Quick Stats:</u><br><b>Name:</b> Fujisaki Suguru<br><b>DOB:</b> July 6th<br>

<b>2003 Updates</b><br><br>
<b>11.01.2003</b>: Apologies for not updating for such a long time. X_x College has proven to be more time-consuming than I thought. Anyway, we have 2 new fanart submissions, both located in the <a href="multi.html">Entertainment</a> centre under Fanworks >> Fanart. Also, 1 new lyric in the Lyrics section, the eagerly anticipated English translation to The Rage Beat. Enjoy! Finally, as repayment for going so long without an update, we have a brand new song to download! :D Smashing Blue is available in the music section, in the Entertainment Centre. Now then, you can vote for the next song at the <a href="poll.html">poll</a>. Till next time na no da!
<br><br>
<b>08.13.2003</b>: Hoy. <a href="http://cloverpetals.com/addiction">Addiction</a> has been updated with 98 new images in the B&W scans section. That completes Addiction's coverage on volume 06 of the manga. XD Volume 07 will be next. 
<br><br>
<b>08.02.2003</b>: 1 new wallpaper in the <a href="multi.html">Entertainment</a> centre with Ryuichi as the coverboy. It matches the current layout. XD Also, 1 new winamp skin, also matching the current layout. --; I also changed the <a href="prelude.html">Prelude</a> and Introduction page around, fitting both into the same layout, hopefully to lighten up the bandwidth load. Also, all the songs are back online, even though I deleted 3 of them (Jurejurenaru Kisetsu, No Style and Love Stuff) to lighten up on the bandwidth. Finally, there's one new fanfiction that was submitted, so check it out <a href="fancream.html">here</a>. The Fan Submission Guidelines has also been updated.
<br><br>
<b>07.21.2003</b>: The <a href="purchase.html">Purchase</a> section has once again been updated. This time, I switched the overall layout format and made it a little more organized and more detailed. The improved version features complimentary images along with descriptions, and just about every major official product is listed, so check it out! Also, a new addition to the Entertainment Centre, the <a href="puzzle.html">Gravitation Jigsaw Puzzle</a>! It's strangely addicting. XD Finally, I made new images for the <a href="quiz">character quiz</a>, so retake it if you'd like, and check out the images. XD
<br><br>
<b>07.08.2003</b>: Ok, since <a href="http://www.anime-expo.org/">AX (Anime Expo 2003)</a> just ended, I'm sure everyone's got Gravitation cosplay pictures. So, send them in! If you want to share your cosplay images with the rest of the Gravi community, please <a href="mailto:trinity@ainoyume.net">e-mail</a> me with the link to your images (no attachments please ._.) Credit will go respectively, so send them in now! XD Also, 1 new <a href="visdub03.html">Visitor's Response</a>, again commenting on the dubbed Gravitation. I also had a chance to surf around and updated the <a href="purchase.html">Purchase</a> section with more online stores. Finally, there are new <a href="linkdtd.html">Link DtD</a> buttons for linkage. XD;; I forgot to mention these on the last update.
<br><br>
<b>06.07.2003</b>: More fanfiction! chapters <a href="fanpiece02.html">2</a> and <a href="fanpiece03.html">3</a> of Anomay's Piece of Love is available at DtD now. Also, <a href="http://cloverpetals.com/addiction" target="_blank">Addiction</a> has 102 new images in volume 5 of the B & W section. See the updates section at Addiction for more details. Now onto a non-site, but still Gravi-related note: <a href="http://ainoyume.net/gravi.logs">Gravi Logs</a> has a new layout. XD
<br><br>
<b>05.22.2003</b>: I apologize for the lack of updates for the past month or so, but schoolwork must come first, ne? XD Anyway, the pink layout is definitely gone, I've had my share of pink for a while. So, a new layout on the main page, as plainly seen. This layout is Ryuichi-full, XD featuring one of my all time favorite images of him, from volume 5 of the Gravitation manga. We have 2 new pieces of fanfiction in the <a href="multi.html">Entertainment</a> Centre for your enjoyment. :D There's also a new <a href="visseason01.html">Visitor's Feedback</a> regarding another season of Gravi, so please feel free to check that out. Finally, <a href="http://cloverpetals.com/addiction" target="_blank">Addiction</a> is back! Look for new black and white images soon. 
<br><br>
<b>03.21.2003</b>: I forgot to mention this in the last update, but I accidentally deleted DtD's <a href="http://dtd.ainoyume.net/cgi-bin/guestbook.cgi">guestbook</a> recently but it's back now. :D Feedback would be appreciated. ^.^ I also made the <a href="http://dtd.ainoyume.net/feedback.html">Feedback</a> form for <a href="essays.html">Essays and Articles</a> more specific, please note that this feedback form only concerns the Essays and Articles section, so don't use it for requests and such.
<br><br>
<b>03.16.2003</b>: Lots of written work on this update. :3 It's about time more content rolled around anyhow. xD For those of you thinking of checking out Gravi, I wrote a <a href="prelude.html">prelude</a> page that gives some insight on whether Gravi is a series for you or not. I probably should have done this first, prior to any other content :P but I didn't think of it until now. xD Next, a new <a href="visdub02.html">visitor's response</a> for the dubbed Gravi topic, although it's a short one. :3 There's also a <a href="track12.html">Track 12 Analysis</a> up in the Essays & Articles section, where I give my take on why things happen the way they did towards the end of the series. XD I also did a layout switch over in the <a href="introd.html">Intro to Gravi</a> section...still blue but now with scenes from the manga, anime and OAVs. Then there's the layout switch here at the Updates section, featuring Sakano. :D Finally, the <a href="links.html">links</a> section has been updated with a few new links in the General and Tohma Shrines.<br><br>
<b>02.21.2003</b>: What's new this time, you ask? Quite a few things, especially in the fanworks section in the <a href="multi.html">entertainment</a> centre. One new fanart submission, thanks a bunch to Zsilee for the submission! We also have two new fanfic submissions, one from Anomay (Tatsuha x Ryuichi goodness XD) and the other from Tasia Chiba (very sweet :3). So run along and have a look. <a href="http://cloverpetals.com/addiction" target="_blank">Addiction</a> has a minor update, explaining the reason behind some 'broken' images. Visit the updates on Addiction for more details.<br><br>
<b>02.02.2003</b>: Version 5 of Dare to Dream is up. I sincerely apologize if it's a killer on your eyes, or if it's too sugary. I personally don't fancy pink and red much, but since Valentine's Day is approaching, I figured I should do something lovey-dovey related. xP To be honest, I find the layout must too sugary for tastes, so rest assured this one won't stay up for too long. The only thing I like is the image of Yuki and Shuichi XD It's too adorable to pass up. :3 Also, I've posted Fan Submission Guidelines under the Fanworks section in the <a href="multi.html">Entertainment</a> Centre for anyone wishing to post their fanworks on DtD. Please read these guidelines before submitting. Thanks. :3 Finally, I switched the layout in the <a href="site.html">Site Related</a> Centre, and placed all the links onto one <a href="links.html">links</a> page, since there aren't many Gravi sites.<br><br>
<b>01.12.2003</b>: This round of updates includes a new layout in the <a href="http://www.shounen-ai.org/dream/ring" target="_blank">Dreaming Gravitation</a> webring, and the ring has moved to its own folder. The layout features various pages of scans from the newest manga volume: Volume 12. The <a href="new_2002.html" target="_blank">updates of 2002</a> have also been moved to its individual page, and that will always be available at the bottom of this page. The artist of the latest fanart has been found. ^.^<br><br>
<b>01.10.2003</b>: Well, more avatars have been added, and there's a new layout for the <a href="epsumm.html">Episode Summaries</a> section, featuring our favorite vocalists, Shuichi and Ryuichi. <3 The image was scanned and edited from the latest Gravi soundtrack, the Sound Story III. Enjoy!<br><br>
<b>01.05.2003</b>: Happy New Year! It's been almost a month without updates here. o_o Don't worry, I haven't disappeared. Now then, we have one new fanart submitted, but I accidentally deleted the e-mail so I am now looking for the artist. Meanwhile, visit the fanart section in the <a href="multi.html" target="_top">Entertainment Centre</a> for the fanart. Also, I've been getting opinions in my <a href="http://subdomainated.faerie-girl.net/cgi-bin/guestbook.cgi" target="_blank">gbook</a> about my dubbing essay mostly. So, I've decided to open up a response section for those of you who want to respond and write your own essay/article. Just make sure your language is appropriate and your arguments reasonable. I love opinions and it'll be great to have different views and theories. In any case, a <a href="http://ainoyume.net/dtd/feedback.html">feedback form</a> has been set up for your convenience. So if you've got an opinion, send away! Also, all of the music in the Entertainment Centre <b>works</b>, if it still doesn't work for you, I'm guessing you have Windows XP and it's giving you a cached page. So, I suggest going into Internet Options, going under "Temporary Internet Files," click settings and check "every visit to the page" for the first option. Then refresh the music page. Finally, there are new avatars up, mostly in the 60x60 section. Check those out in the <a href="multi.html" target="_top">Entertainment Centre</a> as well.

<b>>> Sakano - Personality</b><p>
<div align="justify"><img src="images/saka01.jpg" align=left border=1>Sakano is the spaze king of the show. Starting from the very beginning, he would be alarmed by the smallest mistake. When Shuichi was late, Sakano was nervous. When he turns to see Shuichi sleeping and not listening to him, he turns into a tornado. -.- The next day when Shuichi didn't have the lyrics finished, he tears through the hall and jumps out the window. He does have a reason to worry at times, because there's a slight change in plans and he is always the last one to know about it.^_^ He just wants to be prepared and organized. Moreover, he wants to know what's going to happen next, and that's a bit hard with K in charge and Shuichi to take care of. Other times, he just talks himself into a frenzy. He's a major part of the comic relief of the series, even though sometimes you'd raise an eyebrow before laughing at his outrageous behavior. </p>
<p><img src="images/saka00.jpg" align=right border=1>Sakano really can't handle any major news, whether good or bad. He is always nervous in front of Tohma, fidgeting with his tie, bowing and apologizing before Tohma says a word. When Tohma fires him as a manager, he faints. He doesn't really know how to joke around or to take a joke, he would always tell Shuichi to be serious and tell everyone to be calm before a concert. In reality, he's the only one who's nervous. Sakano is a pretty harmless guy, always over-worried and frantic. He just wants an organized and planned day without Shuichi doing something stupid.

<b>>> Sakuma Ryuichi - Friends</b><p>
<div align="justify"><img src="images/rfriends.jpg" align=left border=1>Shuichi adores Ryuichi and acts a lot like him.^-^ So of course, Ryuichi's good friends with Shuichi. Even though they're rivals technically, Ryuichi still helped Shuichi numerous times, saving him from embarrassment and such. :D Ryuichi even asked for Shuichi's autograph.^-^</p>
<p><img src="images/rfriends0.jpg" align=left border=1>Tohma is also a part of Nittle Grasper, so naturally, he and Ryuichi are also good friends. The two make a great combination along with Noriko. Ryuichi always seem to cheer Tohma up when he's down or stressed by work. Ryuichi is almost always cheerful around Tohma, and he brings happiness whereever he goes. XD<br><br><p><img src="images/rfriends1.jpg" align=left border=1>Noriko is the third member of Nittle Grasper and she also gets along with Ryuichi very well.^_^ She said she could never hate Ryuichi (who can? :P) and she loves to hang around him. She refuses to let Ryuichi make a fool of himself by asking for Shuichi's autograph^-^ but she's very fond of him.

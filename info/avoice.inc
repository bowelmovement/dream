<img src="images/tanaka.jpg" align="left" border=1>Tanaka Rie is Ayaka's seiyuu. She was born in Sapporo, Hokkaido on January 3. Along with the role of Ayaka, she's also done anime roles such as Noda Yumemi in Detective Conan, Mizuki in Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure, Saki in Koutetsu Tenshi Kurumi, and Tanaka Ouji in Legend of Black Heaven. Her post popular role would probably be as Chii in Chobits. In addiction to these roles, she is also a singer and has a couple of CDs out. :)<br><br>
<img src="images/tanaka0.jpg" align="right" border=1>A lot of Ayaka's personality comes through in her voice, and as Ayaka's voice in Gravitation, Tanaka Rie does a great job of portraying Ayaka. Ayaka's a soft-spoken girl for the most part, yet a determined girl as well. Rie needed to express both of those qualities in Ayaka, and she does. Ayaka is very soft-spoken when talking to Yuki, but determined, threatening and firm when she warned Shuichi. Rie also implied sadness in Ayaka's voice when she was asking Hiro to return to Bad Luck, since Ayaka was grieving over losing Yuki. Overall, she's done a good job in bringing out Ayaka's personality.

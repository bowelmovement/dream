<b>>> Seguchi Mika - Loves</b><p>
<div align="justify"><img src="images/mika07.jpg" align=left border=1>Mika is currently married to Seguichi Tohma, and by the hints in the manga, they have a happy relationship and Mika is even assumed to be pregnant. ^-^ Mika loves Tohma deeply, he is one of the only ones that Mika expresses affection towards. When Tohma goes to the airport, planning to leave for New York, Mika is there with him, worried about both he and Yuki. Mika and Tohma are both stubborn people who like to get their way, and somehow this relationship works well like that. :P Tohma has the tendency to take advantage of his position as president of NG Productions, and Mika has the ability to persuade Tohma to have full support for Bad Luck if needed. Both of them are used to getting their ways, and some even say their marriage was for business intentions only. Personally, I don't believe that's true, since they seem to be happy with each other and they aren't constantly taking advantage of each other's business positions.^_^ Although the phrase "opposites attract" doesn't apply in this case, Mika seems to have a decent relationship with Tohma. :D

<b>>> Nakano Hiroshi - Summary</b><p>
<div align="justify"><img src="images/hiro.jpg" align=left border=1>Nakano Hiroshi is better known as Hiro. He is also a pretty straightforward guy, caring, talented, charming, and extremely brilliant. During a quiz show, he answered every single question right with a terribly bored look on his face. ^^ He is probably the best friend someone could ever have, and Shuichi is certainly lucky to have him as a friend. Hiro is bisexual and was infatuated with Shuichi in the beginning of the series. When he found out that Shuichi has fallen for <a href="yuki.php">Eiri Yuki</a>, he was cool about it. Hiro cares deeply about Shuichi and takes care to let others know that. He once told Yuki that if Shuichi ever has any reason to cry, other than out of his own stupidity, he would never forgive Yuki. After Usami Ayaka came into Hiro's life, he seemed to fall for her. This was confirmed when he confessed it to Shuichi.</p>
<p><img src="images/hiro01.jpg" align=right border=1>Hiro is usually calm and mature, but after he started dating <a href="ayaka.php">Usami Ayaka</a>, he seems to lighten up a bit, going off on ten hour long phone calls and such. Even when he first met her, he went to an all night karaoke with her. <_< Hiro is always giving advice because as soon as something goes wrong with Yuki, Shuichi would come running to Hiro to pour out his feelings. Time after time, Hiro gives him advice on how to sort things out with Yuki, even though he's somewhat jealous of Yuki. As a guitarist, there wasn't much shown in the anime regarding his abilities. He certainly has talent, but Tohma once mentioned that there are better guitarists in NG Productions. </p><p>Overall, Hiro is brilliant, talented, caring, and handsome.^^ He's a pretty well rounded guy who gives good advice and can be silly once in a while.<br><br><u>Quick Stats:</u><br><b>Name:</b> Nakano Hiroshi<br><b>Spelling Alternatives:</b> Hiro<br><b>DOB:</b> August 4th<br>

<b>>> Seguchi Mika - Seiyuu</b><p>
<div align="justify"><img src="images/tsuru.jpg" align=left border=1>Mika's seiyuu is Tsuru Hiromi. She was born in Chitose, Hokkaidou on March 29th, 1960 but was raised in Kanagawa. She works for Aoni Production and has blood type A. Some of her major anime roles include Buruma in Dragonball & Dragonball Z, Bulma in Dragonball GT, Jeanne d'Arc in Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne, and Meryl Stryfe in Trigun. In addition, she's also done voice roles as Kuonji Ukyou and Daikoku Kaori in Ranma 1/2, Kim Kaviroff in Macross, and Kiddy Phenil in Silent Mobius. </p>
<p><img src="images/Tsuru0.jpg" align=right border=1>Mika's voice is pretty decent^^ not too squeaky or young sounding. Hiromi portrays Mika very well, since she's always worried and the worry can by heard in Hiromi's voice. I haven't seen any season of Dragonball yet (mainly because I hate the series :P), so I don't know how she does for Buruma and Bulma. I haven't heard her in any of her other roles either, but I'm looking forward to hearing more of her voice. :D

<p><img src="images/takimoto0.jpg" align=right>In my opinion, Fujiko is as cute as Suguru. XD I noticed that Suguru's seiyuu was female sounding, and at first I thought Suguru was a girl. :P She even looks somewhat like Suguru in the first picture shown, with short hair. I love it when Suguru yells at Shuichi. He sounds hilarious and adorable.

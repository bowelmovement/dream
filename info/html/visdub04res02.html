Below are some visitors' response to some of the issues addressed in the <a href="essays.html">Essays and Articles</a> section. I would like to stress that these are opinions, so I don't want to see flames and such. If you'd like to respond to one of the responses, send it in the feedback form. Otherwise, enjoy. :)<br><br>#4) <b>By: <a href="mailto:DarkEternity@hotmail.com">Meis</a></b><br><b>Regarding:</b> Amy's response to Meis's opinion<br><b>Submitted:</b> Feb. 17, 2004<br><br>
<font color=black><b>Webmistress's note:</b> This sounded a bit hostile at the beginning, but I'm glad it turned out alright. </font><br><br>
Amy, I wasn't even talking to you.  I was talking about people in general.  I was a little steamed the day I made that comment and it was just a way of getting things off my shoulders.  If you will read: Amy's response to Meis's opinion.  It says opinion.  JUST an opinion.  Nothing more, nothing less.  So does that make me a bad person for voicing my opinion?  I don't know where you live, but here in America we believe in freedom of speech.  And I am not willing to give up that freedom.  And I said that once you learn Japanese, English sounds sloppy.  It doesn't mean I hate the language.  I just find Japanese easier to understand.  Spanish is even better for me.  But I do not yet know enough of the Japanese language to write out anything or even speak it really.  I just understand it when I hear it.  Just like with any language.  When people learn the basics they can read or hear it just fine.  But speaking and writing is the real challenge.  I should have rephrased my comment on not liking English.  I enjoy speaking English, not American.  All the added slang just isn't my thing.  And on the comment I made on talking about Americans;  I have lived in the same part in the US my whole life.  I only know what goes on right where I am.  And there is so much racism, sexism, etc., that I can't really stand it.  I based it on my opinion of my surroundings.  Not as a whole.  Which was very wrong of me.  But wouldn't you find it rather annoying if you got criticized for watching Gravitation because it is 'sexually immoral?'
<br><br>
Sorry if whatever I said offended you.  None of it was directed toward anyone.  I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me and not think of me as some selfish pig.  I would actually like to talk to your though email if at all possible.  I like the way you bashed me.  =D  Couldn't have done it better to someone else myself. =P  Once again, Sorry.

Below are some visitors' response to some of the issues addressed in the <a href="essays.html">Essays and Articles</a> section. I would like to stress that these are opinions, so I don't want to see flames and such. If you'd like to respond to one of the responses, send it in the feedback form. Otherwise, enjoy. :)<br><br>#4) <b>By: <a href="mailto:Unicorn1799@aol.com">Amy</a></b><br><b>Regarding:</b> Meis's response to <u>The Future Dubs Issue</u><br><b>Submitted:</b> Feb. 06, 2004<br><br>
<font color=black><b>Webmistress's note:</b> Amy quoted Meis on several occasions, and those instances are in quotes and italicized to avoid confusion.</font><br><br>
To this essay...which is beyond hypocritical and contradicting that its just plain funny, also false context. I think there is pressure on Dub VA's. People go on about how the dub actor doesn't sound like the original, case in point 'they don't HAVE to' thats not the point of dubbing, IMO its to look back at the original track for reference take that and create your own voice for the character, not just copy.<br><br>
<i>"As I have read, some people like the English dub more than the Japanese original. Now I think that is just wrong. The Japanese original is always the best. "</i>
<br><br>
I didn't read any such thing. I've read that people like the 'original AND the dub'. And that they were happy to see it dubbed. And saying that the Japanese original is the best seems to be putting your opinion on someone else. Rather forcing. 
<br><br>
<i>"And most of the time the peoples opinions are completely false. Most likely, if you watch the dub first then the original will sound different. And on the comment someone made about not liking to listen the the Japanese Language... Grow up."</i>
<br><br>
For example yours would include this People are allowed to watch any track they want, and vice versa to the statement of 'sound different'. Thats just a duh factor. I never said I didn't like it. I've watched anime in the original track first and will still find voices I didn't like listening to. Its my choice. 
<br><br>
<i>"If you don't like it then don't listen/watch the anime. Being small minded is actually comical to people who aren't. In my humble opinion, the Japanese language is beautiful. English sounds sloppy to you once you learn Japanese."</i>
<br><br>
Once again you show your own example of being small minded. At least there are some anime fans who can watch both tracks and have opinions on them -positive or negative- Its a choice to watch what you want not someone elses. And if the English language is too sloppy for you, learn to type this essay in Japanese. First you think its insulting to not like Japanese language and then you go and insult the English one... Is German, French, or Swahili sloppy too? 
<br><br>
<i>"And if you complain about the subs being bad, then why not learn Japanese and just listen to it without complaining? This just proves that Americans are by far the most stupid race of humans alive."</i>
<br><br>
Learning Japanese has nothing to do with me liking the voices any better. I can complain as much as I want. I AM A ANIME FAN I have a right to say how I feel about a series. Now we are insulting nationalities...you don't think very far do you? Once again at least I can make honest judgment on both dialogues instead of praising one because its "JAPANESE" You are basically the type of fan I dislike...you are very one-sided and resort to name calling. Why can't people like you realize "No one has to like what I like" So if the creator of this site is American...does your word still stick?

<b>>> Nakano Hiroshi - Personality</b><p>
<div align="justify"><img src="images/hiro04.jpg" align=left border=1>Hiro is a well rounded guy. Aside from being a talented guitarist, he's also a genius and a very caring and dedicated person. It was Hiro who saw that Shuichi was in love with Yuki and persuaded him to go and confess his love to Yuki.^-^ Hiro was infatuated with Shuichi in the beginning of the series, but Shuichi didn't notice until Hiro gave him a huge hint that "he's getting lonely" after Shuichi rambled about Yuki. XDD Hiro did not make a fuss when he realized that Shuichi was in love with someone. But he went to Yuki's place and told him that if Shuichi ever has any reason to cry, other than because of his sheer stupidity, he would never forgive Yuki. He kept his word too, as we see later when Shuichi was sexually abused by Tachi and his henchmen and asked Hiro if it was wrong to love someone with tears streaming down his face. Hiro went straight to Yuki and confronted him right afterwards.</p>
<p><img src="images/hiro03.jpg" align=right border=1>As the guitarist of Bad Luck, Hiro is very dedicated to his work. He doesn't like being used, but then again, who does? When K used Shuichi and Yuki's relationship to sell 1 million CDs, he quit Bad Luck because he isn't making music to sell 1 million CDs. He was later persuaded by Ayaka to rejoin Bad Luck, because she told him that if Bad Luck sold 1 million CDs, she will date him. XD Hiro is pretty lenient about K's managing, unlike <a href="suguru.php">Suguru</a>, who wasn't as tolerant. He is the sensible one that's willing to back off if needed. He also puts up with Shuichi and encourages the Shuichi x Yuki relationship even though he is jealous of Yuki. All in all, he is basically the smart and mature guitarist of the crew.

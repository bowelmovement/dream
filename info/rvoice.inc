<b>>> Sakuma Ryuichi - Seiyuu</b><p>
<div align="justify"><img src="images/kappei.jpg" align=left border=1>Ryuichi's seiyuu is Yamaguchi Kappei, one of my personal favorite seiyuu. xD He was born in Fukuoka on May 23rd, 1965. His real name is Yamaguchi Mitsuo. He is currently working for Gekidan 21 Seiki Fox and he's done some major and minor anime roles. Some of his major roles include Inuyasha in Inuyasha,^^ Noin in Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne, and he was Saotome Ranma in the Ranma 1/2 debut. In addition, he's done the voice of Etoh in Record of Lodoss War, Nichol in Plastic Little, and Chesta/Shesta, one of the 15 Zaibach Dragon Slayers in Tenkuu no Escaflowne. I love Shesta's voice XD he's one of my favorite Esca characters. Other character roles include Osamu from Mamono Hunter Yohko (Devil Hunter Yohko), Sumeragi Subaru from Tokyo Babylon, and Takurou from Wedding Peach.</p>
<p><img src="images/kappei0.jpg" align=right border=1>I absolutely *love* Ryuichi's voice! XD He is adorable sounding and cracks me up all the time.^-^ I really adore the voice of as Ryuichi, no seiyuu could have done his voice better. :) brings out the full personality of Ryuichi and makes him the adorable yet talented vocalist. Ryuichi is known for saying "na no da" randomly^^ and I love hearing him say that. :D Even Ryuichi's whining voice is so cute, you can't resist him. XDD I have not heard him in any of his other roles except for Shesta, whom I loved.^_^ His Shesta voice is a bit harder to distinguish, since Shesta's a far more serious person than Ryuichi, and he's a high-tech assassion, being one of the 15 elite Dragon Slayer pilots. XD It's known that Ryuichi's singing voice in the anime is not Kappei, but the newest Nittle Grasper song from the Gravitation Sound Story III, called Predilection, is indeed sung by Kappei himself.

<img src="images/noriko02.jpg" align="left" border=1><img src="images/noriko03.jpg" align="right" border=1>Noriko is your typical anime shoujo. Her first appearance is around episode 8, and her first introduction is a genki and cheerful girl with a girlish voice. She's very confident of herself and never hesitates to speak her mind. =P She is very talented as a keyboardist for Nittle Grasper, she has the ability to play 2 or 3 keyboards all at once. o.O K is the only person besides Tohma and Ryuichi that seemed to know Noriko, most likely because he's been Ryuichi's manager. His relationship with Noriko is pretty much mutual. XD She refuses to let K near Ryuichi, or even touch Ryuichi, because she claimed he deceived and took Ryuichi away to America. =P She argues with K while clinging to Ryuichi. XD K gets frustrated with her at times, with her dramatic ways.^-^ Noriko's also very stylish, her clothes are always more or less revealing.

<b>>> Sakano - Summary</b><p>
<div align="justify"><img src="images/saka.jpg" align=left border=1>Sakano was both the manager and producer for Bad Luck in the beginning of the series. However, he wasn't so good as the manager, Tohma found Shuichi's behavior intolerable and fired him as a manager. Now, he is only the producer of Bad Luck while <a href="k.php">K</a> becomes the manager. Sakano's first name has never been mentioned in the anime or the manga, and everyone simply calls him Sakano or Sakano-san. Sakano works under Tohma and obeys his every orders. He is constantly trying to please Tohma with Bad Luck's successes and gets quite nervous whenever something goes wrong. Even as the producer, he makes little decisions on his own and he is always turning to <a href="tohma.php">Seguchi Tohma</a> or letting K run the show. The only time that he made a decision without K's consent was when Tohma told him to do so. ^_^ </p>
<p><img src="images/saka0.jpg" align=right border=1>In the end, Sakano does make 1 decision on his own. That is, after he plead for help was rejected by Tohma. When Shuichi lost his voice, he orders a roomful of sumo wrestlers to pile up on Shuichi. Obviously, Sakano thought this would bring Shuichi's voice back somehow. O_o For the most part, he does his job of producing and let K manage the band. Since K has a tendency to go to the extreme, and Sakano has the tendency of making everything seem like a crisis, Sakano is always alarmed at K's bold decisions or Shuichi's rapid changing mood. <br><br><u>Quick Stats:</u><br><b>Name:</b> Sakano<br><b>DOB:</b> September 19th<br>

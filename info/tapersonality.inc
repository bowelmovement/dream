<b>>> Uesugi Tatsuha - Personality</b><br><br>
<div align="justify"><img src="images/tatsuha01.jpg" align=left border=1>Tatsuha's a care-free, daredevil kind of guy, even though he doesn't seem to get into trouble too much. <.< He's always running errands for his father, but I'm sure he does some devilish stuff behind his father's back. >D Part of his job is to get Yuki's come back home, as Mika's trying to do. He doesn't have much connections, he gets most of his rare Ryuichi stuff from Yuki's connection with Tohma and so on. He's also responsible for bring Ayaka to Yuki, although he doesn't exactly do that in the end. o.o</p>
<p><img src="images/tatsuha02.jpg" align=right border=1>Tatsuha loves trickery and that's exactly what he does with Shuichi and Yuki's relationship. Therefore, he's plays a significant part in bringing Shuichi and Yuki back together. Even though Tatsuha glomped Shuichi due to his resemblance to Ryuichi, he was just kidding around and having fun, nothing serious. As mentioned before, Tatsuha likes excitment and adventure, a rather easy-going person. :D

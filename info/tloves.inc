<b>>> Seguchi Tohma - Loves</b><p>
<div align="justify"><img src="images/tohma03.jpg" align=left border=1>Tohma is married to Mika, Yuki's older sister, although their relationship in the anime seems to be more of a business resolution than anything else. o.0 Opposites attract doesn't really fit this case, since Tohma and Mika are very alike. They're both manipulative and both have the power to get what they want. Their relationship isn't explained very well in the anime, but Tohma does appear to love Mika though. As the manga hinted, the two are expecting their first baby.^^ </p>
<p><img src="images/tohma04.jpg" align=left border=1>Tohma is very fond of Yuki and thinks of himself as Yuki's guardian. One could say that he loves Yuki very much. Now whether that love is romantic or brotherly, fans are free to determine by themselves.^^ Tohma seems to go to great measures to protect Yuki, and he tells Tachi that Yuki is the most important person in his life. Yuki doesn't return this feeling, but he does think of Tohma as more than a friend. Just one fluctuation in Yuki's health and Tohma will take care of what he thinks is the problem.

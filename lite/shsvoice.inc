<b>>> Shindou Shuichi - Singing Voice</b><br><br>
<div align="justify"><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/kinya.jpg" align=left border=1>Shuichi's singing voice is Kotani Kinya, who probably ranks as one of my favorite male singers. XDD Kinya was born in Saitama on July 16, 1979, and he is currently working for Haikyou. He sings basically all of Bad Luck's songs, including the Rage Beat, Spicy Marmalade, Blind Game Again, Glaring Dream, Smashing Blue, etc. He actually sings most of the songs in Gravitation, with the exception of Sleepless Beauty and Shining Collection, sung by The Seeker and Iceman, respectively. There's also Super Drive, sung by the talented Sakanoue Yosuke. Kinya has one album out called HISTORY P-20. you don't hear him much anywhere else except for Gravitation. </p>
<p><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/kinya0.jpg" align=right border=1>Kinya's songs are all full of emotion and dedication. You can hear the effort he puts forth in his songs. Kotani Kinya never fails to entertain me with his songs. :) You can't help but sing along with him, especially in Glaring Dream. Some other Gravi songs he sings are Yuustu Na Seven Days, Love Stuff, and Jurejurenaru Kisetsu. He's a very talented artist, although it's quite hard to find English sites on him. I definitely recommend adding his soundtrack to your wishlist. XD<br>

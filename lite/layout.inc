<b>Layout Information</b><br><br>
You are currently viewing version 4.0 of the Lite Graphics version of Dare to Dream, featuring various manga scans of pairing between Yuki, Shuichi, Ryuichi and Sakano from the cover of the now running manga series. The entire Lite Graphics version of DtD is in PHP format for convenience. Images used for layouts were all scanned from artbooks or DVD covers. All graphics were edited in <a href="http://www.jasc.com" target="_blank">Paint Shop Pro 7.02</a>. The fonts used for were Arial Narrow, Century Gothic and Verdana. You can find all these fonts and almost any font at <a href="http://www.fontseek.com" target="_blank">Font Seek</a>.<br><br>All layouts are best viewed with 800x600 resolutions using F11, and all layouts should be viewed with 800x600 resolutions or higher. It probably looks ok on Netscape, but I haven't gotten the time to try it out yet.<br><br>Please do not take any of the edited graphics for your own usage. If I find out (which I will), I will not be polite to you and severe consequences will result. Thank you for reading and have a lovely day. ;)<br><br>

<img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/norikotohma.jpg" align="left" border=1>Noriko and Tohma have worked together for quite a while, Noriko can tell just by the stiffness of his smile that Tohma's got something on his mind. Noriko and Tohma, together with Ryuichi, prove to be one heck of a team :D Noriko respects Tohma and knows him quite well. The two are very good friends and they make a good combination for Nittle Grasper.<br><br><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/norikoryui.jpg" align="left" border=1>Noriko seems to adore Ryuichi a lot, taken by his cuteness.^^ She's seen more often with Ryuichi than with Tohma or anyone else. She would come to Ryuichi's defense very easily and wouldn't let anyone be close to him other than herself and Tohma.^^ Ryuichi seems to think Noriko's simply a good friend and nothing more.

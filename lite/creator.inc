Maki Murakami's first work of manga was in the 1995 April issue of "Kimito Boku." Her work
was titled "Narushisuto No Higeki," roughly translating to "the Tragedy of a narcissist." She became popular with her amazing creation of Gravitation. In the shounen-ai genre, Gravitation is one of the most popular anime along with Yami no Matsuei and several others. Ms. Murakami's progress with Gravitation has currently come to a halt at volume 12. Whether or not the manga series will continue is indefinite at this time.<br><br>Aside from the Gravitation manga series, Ms. Murakami is also the artist for all of the Gravitation Remixes, a doujinshi  series that furthers the relationship of Yuki x Shuichi, as well as introduce new pairings, odd pairings and incest pairings. While the anime/manga is mostly restricted to shounen-ai, the Remixes are pure yaoi.

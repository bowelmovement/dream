<b>>> Nakano Hiroshi - Friends</b><p>
<div align="justify"><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/shui1.jpg" align=left border=1>Hiro's friends are no big mysteries. Shuichi and Hiro have been friends for as far back as middle school. Even back then, they imitated Sakuma Ryuichi and wanted a band. As usual, Shuichi was always late on getting lyrics and songs done. Hiro's always looking out for Shuichi while Shuichi manages to keep things interesting with his ever changing personality. They are complete opposites but somehow manages to remain friends.</p>
<p><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/fujisaki.jpg" align=right border=1>Suguru and Hiro are more alike. They're both mature and collected most of the time. They both have the patience to deal with Shuichi and they're both members of Bad Luck.^_^ Hiro's never had a problem with Suguru being in Bad Luck, while Shuichi wanted the band to be just him and Hiro. Although Suguru isn't as close to Hiro as Shuichi is, he's still a good friend and partner. They work well together and have had some good accomplishments.<br>

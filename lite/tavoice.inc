<p><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/ishikawa0.jpg" align=right border=1>Tatsuha...what can I say? He sounds cute and he looks cute.^^ He has a sense of humor and he's fun to watch and listen to .^__^ Ishikawa makes Tatsuha sound hilarious when he's talking about Ryuichi.^_^ He also speaks English pretty well XDD Although it's rare to find a serious Tatsuha, he does do a good job in making him sound serious in those situations. All in all, although we don't hear Tatsuha's voice too often, his voice is a great one to listen to in Gravi as well as Bubblegum Crisis.^^<br>

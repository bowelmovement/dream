<b>>> Sakuma Ryuichi - Singing Voice</b><p>
<div align="justify"><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/d_k.jpg" align=left border=1>That's right, Sakuma Ryuichi has singing seiyuu for his great songs.^-^ Many believe that Sleepless Beauty is sung by Iceman, but the actual group is The Seeker. The Seeker is composed of 2 male artists by the names of K.ITO (Kenichi Ito) and D.K (Daichi Kuroda). K.ITO was born on November 20th, 1971 with blood type A. D.K. was born on August 29th with blood type A. He is the vocalist who is Ryuichi's singing voice in the anime. Now for Shining Collection, that song is sung by Iceman. Iceman is a group consisting of three members, Kenichi Ito, Daisuke Asakura (D.A.), and Michihiro Kuroda (M.K). Practically all of the Gravitation songs were produced by Daisuke Asakura. D.A. is the Keyboardist of the group, K.Ito the guitarist, and M.K. the vocalist in Shining Collection. Iceman now consists of two artists, K.Ito and D.A., since Michihiro Kuroda left the group in 2001. </p>
<p><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/kito.jpg" align=right border=1>You just gotta love Ryuichi's voice in Sleepless Beauty and Shining Collection. Even though the vocalists are different, with Sleepless Beauty sung by Daichi Kuroda and Shining Collection sung by Michihiro Kuroda, the songs are still upbeat and great to listen to. both vocalists are quite talented and even though neither Iceman nor The Seeker are popular bands, they've produced awesome music along with some other artists in Gravitation, such as Kotani Kinya and Sakanoue Yosuke. FYI, the featured pictures are D.K. and K.Ito, respectively.<br><br>

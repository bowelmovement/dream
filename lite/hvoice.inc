<b>>> Nakano Hiroshi - Seiyuu</b><p>
<div align="justify"><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/matsumoto.jpg" align=left border=1>Hiro's seiyuu is Matsumoto Yasunori. He was born in Chiba and his birthdate is February 7th, 1960. His blood type is O and he works for Baobab Productions. Besides doing Nakano Hiroshi, he is probably best known for playing Gourry Gabriev in Slayers, Seta in Love Hina, and Kou from Bubblegum Crisis Episode 7. He has done a ton of other roles as well, including Dark Seeder from Lost Universe.</p>
<p><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/matsumoto0.gif" align=right border=1>There isn't much information on Matsumoto on the net. He isn't the seiyuu of very many popular anime, if that accounts for the minimal information on him. Like most seiyuu, he also sings and has some CDs out, mostly the soundtracks of various anime. As Hiroshi, he does a pretty good job of portraying his personality. His voice isn't too old or too young, yet he makes Hiro seem like a mature person. He can be silly when needed, serious when appropriate. I love him as Gourry from Slayers. He's hilarious, even though his voice may seem a little young for Gourry's brute figure.<br>

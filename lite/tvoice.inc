<b>>> Seguchi Tohma - Seiyuu</b><p>
<div align="justify"><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/orikasa.jpg" align=left border=1>Seguchi Tohma's voice actress is the gorgeous Orikasa Ai! XD Her real name is Orihara Kikue and she was born in Tokyo on December 12th, 1963. She has blood type B and works for Baobab Production. Her biggest anime voice role is probably Quatre Raberba Winner from Gundam Wing, but her voice is also found in several other popular anime. She is Ootori Kanae in Shoujo Kakumei Utena, Baikou in Saber Marionette J, Joanne Woo in Battle Athletess Dai Undoukai (Battle Athletes), and the Cheshire Cat in Miyuki-chan in Wonderland. In addition, she's also done Takeuchi Ryoko in Blue Seed, Oryo in Pretty Sami, and Gabusu in Dirty Pair Flash.</p>
<p><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/orikasa0.jpg" align=right border=1>It's somewhat hard to tell that Tohma's voice is played by a girl, but there are some hints.^^ You can definitely tell that she's also the voice of Quatre in Gundam Wing. Quatre and Tohma have an uncanny resemblance as well. :P But the resemblance is only skin deep. Quatre is a rather innocent and good-natured boy, while Tohma's much more deceiving and manipulative. >D Orikasa makes Tohma have a friendly and yet strong-willed personality :D Orikasa puts forth much effort for Tohma's voice to exhibit Tohma's personality, especially the time Tohma threatened Tachi. XD Her voice was very malicious and evil, displaying the darker side of Tohma. >D  Orikasa definitely protrayed Tohma's personality well in her voice acting role. Her role as Quatre is wonderful as well as Kanae in Utena. :D <br>

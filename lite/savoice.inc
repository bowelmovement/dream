<b>>> Sakano - Voice</b><p>
<div align="justify"><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/koyasu.jpg" align=left border=1>Sakano's voice actor is Koyasu Takehito. He was born in Yokohama, Kanagawa and his blood type is A. His birthdate is on May 5th, 1967 and he has the Zodiac sign of Taurus. He also works for Baobab Production, like Matsumoto, Hiro's seiyuu. Besides doing the voice of Sakano, Koyasu has done characters from some of the most popular anime. There's Aoba Shigeru from Neon Genesis Evangelion, Touga Kiryuu from Shoujo Kakumei Utena, Zechs Merquise from Gundam Wing, Hotohori from Fushigi Yuugi, and Daisuke from Ranma 1/2. Some other voice roles include Hanagata from Saber Marionette J and Bull from Cowboy Bebop, as well as Fujimiya Aya from Weiss Kreuz, Rezo from Slayers and Kira Sakuya from Angel Sanctuary. He, as well as Seki Tomokazu (voice of Shuichi), are part of Weiss, a group composed of the male cast of Weiss Kreuz.</p>
<p><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/koyasu0.jpg" align=right border=1>Koyasu portrays Sakano well. He gives Sakano the sense of instability and therefore gives him a personality. I honestly couldn't tell that he was also the voice of Kiryuu Touga from Utena. Touga's voice is a bit more mature and calm. Frankly, I can't remember a time when Sakano sounded calm. Same with Rezo from Slayers. His voice is indeed quite different from the frantic sounding Sakano. But for all of his roles, he does a very good job of bringing out the character's personality.<br>

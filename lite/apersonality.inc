<b>>> Usami Ayaka - Personality</b><br><br>
<div align="justify">
<img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/ayaka02.jpg" align="left" border=1>Ayaka is a strong-willed, determined and stubborn girl. She ran away from home in order to pursue Yuki and hopefully get him to love her. She refuses to give up and even slapped Shuichi and told him that he had no future with Yuki and that they'll only hurt each other if they stayed together. She told him to stay away from Yuki when she found out that he was living with Yuki. Of course, Shuichi is just as stubborn as well, and counters with yelling "YUKI'S MINE!!" on top of his lungs during a concert. <.< After that, Ayaka pretty much knew she had no chance, and backed off. <br><br>
<img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/ayaka03.jpg" align="right" border=1>Ayaka still cares for Yuki though, even though she knew she wouldn't have a decent chance with him. She knew Yuki didn't love her and wouldn't be happy if he married her. She simply wanted Yuki to be happy, and she will let go of him if needed. :) Ayaka is a strong girl, she is willing and able to let of of the person she loves the most while keeping a smile on her face. She can go forward with her life knowing that Yuki will be happy, although he's not with her.<br><br>

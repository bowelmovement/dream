He and Yuki are more than good friends, Tohma thinks of himself as Yuki's guardian. He would go to extreme measures to make sure that Yuki is protected from any sort of harm, physically or emotionally. Yuki is the most important person in his life, he even confesses this. He almost killed Tachi for toying with Yuki and threatening him, and he has told Shuichi more than once to stay away from Yuki after he threw up blood.</p>

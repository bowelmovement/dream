<b>>> Seguchi Tohma - Personality</b><p>
<div align="justify"><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/tohma00.jpg" align=left border=1>As I mentioned before, Tohma is multi-faceted and his looks can be deceiving. He may seem to be a harmless Quatre-like character on the outside, but he's very manipulative and deceiving on the inside.^^ He is extremely protective of people he loves, this is especially the case with Yuki. He will do almost anything for Yuki to ensure his protection, he makes Yuki's business his own business. He does what he thinks is best for Yuki, and that's the reason why he *disciplined" Tachi and told Shuichi to stay away from Yuki. Tohma is so protective of Yuki because he blames himself for Yuki's tragedy and he's overwhelmed by guilt and the frustration of not knowing Kitazawa well enough (for Tohma hired Kitazawa to be Yuki's tutor) and letting Yuki endure pain. </p>
<p><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/tohma02.jpg" align=right border=1>Tohma may seem selfish or unforgiving, going to extreme measures and giving people something to remember for laying their hands on Yuki. When Yuki's memory started coming back, Tohma was over at his house much more often to talk about his illness and what's best for him. As Yuki cries in Tohma's arms, Tohma is torn inside and he results in revenge for the person who harmed Yuki. You can say that Yuki plays a huge part in Tohma's personality, he more or less shaped Tohma to be who he is. Some of Tohma's manipulativeness comes from being a popular band and company president, but much of his guilt, mistrust, and frustration come from Yuki and his past. With the help of genki Shuichi though, Tohma learns that love is something he cannot manipulate sometimes, and sees in the end that Shuichi really does love and help Yuki through his past.<br>

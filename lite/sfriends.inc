<b>>> Fujisaki Suguru - Friends</b><p>This section lists Suguru's friends, those that he works with and his relationships with them. <p>
<img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/shui03.jpg" align=left>Shindou Shuichi and Suguru didn't start out on good terms. Basically, Shuichi was extremely jealous of Suguru's talent and the fact that he can draw so many people's attention with his arrangements for Bad Luck's songs. However Shuichi came to realize that he too has talent (despite what Yuki says^^) and became good friends with Suguru. Shuichi and Suguru work well together in Bad Luck, largely due to Suguru's tolerence for Shuichi's constant mood changes.^_^</p>
<p><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/hiro00.jpg" align=right>Suguru's relationship with Hiro is also pretty good. They are very much alike in some ways. They both put up with Shuichi's hyperness and they are both more mature and act their age. In addition, they work well with each other and with Shuichi, making Bad Luck a big success.

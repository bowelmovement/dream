<b>>> K(Crawd Winchester) - Family</b>
<div align="justify"><p>K's family isn't shown at all in the anime, but they do appear in the manga. You'd be amazed at how much K's wife resembles him, sometimes I wish K's family was in the anime.^^</p><p><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/judy.jpg" align=right border=1>K's family consists of a Hollywood superstar wife and sweet little five year old son. His wife, Judy Winchester, is a gorgeous and yet firey woman whose actions and characteristics resemble those of her husband. <_< She has a habit of smoking and wears sunglasses, pretty much the glamorous all-star Hollywood actress. She also does blackmailing and has a thing for weaponry, so she is quite a match for her husband. XDD </p><p><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/michael.jpg" align=left border=1>K's young son, Michael Winchester, doesn't appear much even in the manga. However, he's five years old and a bundle of cuteness. ^_^ He loves to be with his father, but could use a little more attention from him. From what I can see, he doesn't cause much trouble and is just an ordinary kid. :)<br>

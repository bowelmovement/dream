<b>OAV General Information</b><br><br><center><b>Contains SPOILERS</b></center><br>
First off, OAVs (Original Animation Videos) can also be called OVAs, or Original Video Animations. Both terms are acceptable and used around the net. There are only two Gravitation OAV episodes, both released and available on DVD and VHS. These episodes are suppose to be seen before the actual anime that depict the story in a nutshell and introduce the main characters. <br><br>In the first OAV episode, Shuichi has to overcome his inability to compose lyrics while sorting out problems with Yuki. Things only got worse when Shuichi found out that Yuki wrote the lyrics of a song for Nittle Grasper. Shuichi had hoped that someday, Yuki would write a song for him. At the end of the episode, Shuichi is heartbroken and flees to his own home...

In the second episode, Shuichi struggles to shape up after the discovery that Nittle Grasper is going to perform a song that Yuki had written the lyrics to. He soon realizes that the song that Nittle Grasper performs is about him, and he finally understands and has the energy to sing again. Tohma had this all planned out, the plan for Bad Luck to sing live at the Tokyo Bay Music Festival. This is partly for promotion and partly to get Shuichi out of his slump. 
<br><br>
Overall, the OAV episodes contain a lot more humorous situations than the actual anime. There are also plenty of songs for such a short program, and these songs are not sung in the anime. These songs include Shining Collection, Smashing Blue (ending theme), Spicy Marmalade, In the Moonlight, and Blind Game Again (opening theme). For the most part, the character designs are somewhat different from the actual anime, more in some characters than in others. For example, Ryuichi and Noriko do look quite different from their respective anime selves, while Shuichi, Hiro, Sakano, K, and some others look pretty much the same.  Nevertheless, you should watch the OAV episodes before the anime if you can. The OAVs definitely spice up the anime for Gravitation. :)<br><br>

<table width=600><tr><td valign=top><b>2002 Updates</b><br><br>
<b>12.06.2002</b>: Oya oya..."No Style" has been reuploaded due to the awareness that it didn't get uploaded completely. Yuutsu Na Seven Days has won the "<a href="poll.html">Which-song-to-be-available-for-download-next</a>" poll. =P So that's been uploaded as well. That poll has also been reset with new songs, so start voting for the next one! xD<br><br>
<b>11.17.2002</b>: Two new sections in the Information Centre this time, <a href="creator.html" target="_top">About the creator</a> and a <a href="dictionary.php" target="_top">Gravi dictionary</a> listing all the Gravi and shounen-ai related terms. ^_^ Finding information on Maki Murakami is extremely hard, x_x especially when she doesn't like to show her face, so there are virtually no images of her. O_o; <br><br>
<b>11.03.2002</b>: There were some broken links in the music section, so I changed the URL of them. At any rate, they should be working now. :3 <br><br>
<b>10.30.2002</b>: Ack, updates are getting slimmer and slimmer aren't they? O_o;; Gravi Manga Scans Track1-9 are up at <a href="http://www.cloverpetals.com/addiction" target="_blank">Addiction</a>, as well as some other images. 2 buttons have been added in the <a href="linkdtd.html" target="_top">Link DtD</a> section. xD<br><br>
<b>10.12.2002</b>: Nothing much this time, I just updated the disclaimers so there are no broken links. <.<; I keep forgetting to upload manga tracks 1-9 on Addiction, but I shall do it in the next couple of days. xD<br><br>
<b>10.03.2002</b>: Woah, long time no update. <.< This update refers to <a href="http://www.cloverpetals.com/addiction" target="_blank">Addiction</a> only. :3 New doujinshi section is up, with 28 doujinshi pictures. <3 <3 There are also some new anime and manga images, visit Addiction for the specific updates. Yes, an updates section has been added at Addiction. :3 The current image count is 3,218 images, w00t! xD<br><br>
<b>09.09.2002</b>: <a href="http://www.cloverpetals.com/addiction" target="_blank">Addiction</a> went on hiatus for a day ^^;; but managed to come back very soon, with a new look and easier navigation. I'm pretty satisfied with the new look, hopefully it'll be easier for everyone else as well. New images were uploaded as well, I can't really say which ones since I don't remember <.< But they're in the anime and manga sections. XD The TV animation artbook will be up in the next few days, so look for that. :D Oh yes, Predilection, the newest Gravitation song, is available in the <a href="music.html">music</a> section. It's from the third Sound Story, sung by Ryuichi's seiyuu himself. XDD <a href="lyrics.php">Lyrics</a> for Predilection are also available in the lyrics section.<br><br>
<b>08.31.2002</b>: <a href="cosplay.html">Cosplay</a> pics are the newest section in Multimedia. If you have any cosplay images, feel free to contribute! Also added 2 buttons for <a href="linkdtd.php">Linking DtD</a> since I really don't like my other ones. XD More fanart images have been added, so go and check them out! :D Many thanks to Dawn and Yama for letting me use them.^^<br><br>
<b>08.24.2002</b>: New section in the Multimedia section, <a href="aicons.html">AIM Icons</a>. Of course, more will be made as time goes on, but here are a few to start off with. ^-^<br><br>
<b>08.19.2002</b>: Dare to Dream now has a Lite version for those of you who have a slower connection XD If you're reading this update, you are already in the Lite version. :D I have dial-up myself, so I know how much of a pain that can be. I made the Lite version very graphics lite, so hopefully it'll make a difference for you guys. That way, you can still enjoy the site. :) School starts tomorrow, so updates will slim down. ><<br><br>

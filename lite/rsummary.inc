<b>>> Sakuma Ryuichi - Summary</b><p>
<div align="justify"><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/ryui.jpg" align=left border=1>Sakuma Ryuichi is a hilariously cute character that you can't dislike. He is incredibly gifted and talented in singing, and he is part of Nittle Grasper, the legendary band that sold millions of CDs in just two days. He is 31 years old but for the majority of the time, he acts exactly like a 3 year old. After Nittle Grasper split up, Ryuichi headed off to America to do solo works under K's management. Through K, Ryuichi became a star almost immediately. Ryuichi makes his debut appearance in episode 2 with K, having just came back from the U.S. He went to Bad Luck's opening act along with K and Seguchi Tohma. It was Ryuichi who helped Shuichi get through his first opening act, since Shuichi was in shock from seeing Yuki. </p>
<p><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/ryuichi0.jpg" align=right border=1>Ryuichi has a stuffed bunny named Kumagoro, it is super cute and he plays with it all the time. He would use it to cheer people up or make them realize that it's ok to have fun once in a while. He acts as if Kumagoro is a living, feeling, real character,^^ always speaking to it and for it. :D He acts very cute almost all the time, but when he starts to sing, it looks as if his personality had completely changed, from a 3 year old to an actual 31 year old. Once on stage, Ryuichi is very serious and sings with a great deal of feeling. His performances would leave Shuichi in shock and crying, thinking that he will never surpass the God-like vocalist Ryuichi. Ryuichi thinks of Shuichi as his friend though, and even asked for his autograph.^-^ Overall, Sakuma Ryuichi is the adorable, extremely talented vocalist of Nittle Grasper. :D<br><br><u>Quick Stats:</u><br><b>Name:</b> Sakuma Ryuichi<br><b>Spelling Alternatives:</b> Ryuuichi<br><b>DOB:</b> April 1st<br>

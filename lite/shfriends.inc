<b>>> Shindou Shuichi - Friends</b><br><br>
<div align="justify"><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/shuhiro.jpg" align=left border=1>Hiro is Shuichi's first and best friend. They go back to middle school, when Shuichi worshipped Ryuichi and Nittle Grasper and started acting like Ryuichi. Hiro's been one heck of a friend to Shuichi, being there when he's hurt, depressed, happy, putting up with his many mood swings. He also put aside his love (romantic) for Shuichi and advised him on how to face Yuki. Hiro's probably the best friend Shuichi can ask for, and anyone can get. o.O He's perfect as a friend, neglecting his feelings and giving up time to help his friend in every way possible.</p>
<p><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/shusuguru.jpg" align=left border=1>Suguru is another friend of Shuichi's, although not as close as Hiro. Suguru has patience for putting up with Shuichi day after day, but sometimes Shuichi can get on his nerves and Suguru will tell him to behave and work on the songs. As time goes on, the two become adjusted to each other's comments and learned to get along.^^ Suguru's almost always seen with Hiro, talk to each other about how weird Shuichi's acting. XD
<p><img src="http://dream.shounen-ai.org/info/images/shuryu.jpg" align=left border=1>Ryuichi is probably more of a person to worship than just a friend to Shuichi.^^ Although Ryuichi is in his 30s, he acts like he's 5 most of the time. He asked for Shuichi's autograph and told Noriko that Shuichi was his friend. To that, Shuichi becomes incredibly happy in Ryuichi's acknowledge. Ryuichi's helped Shuichi multiple times, including Shu-chan's first concert. The two are very much alike, mostly because Shuichi wants to act just like Ryuichi. He made his hairstyle the same as Ryuichi and even uses the same shampoo. -.-<br><br><br>

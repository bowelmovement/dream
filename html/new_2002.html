<b>2002 Updates</b><br><br>
<b>12.06.2002</b>: Oya oya..."No Style" has been reuploaded due to the awareness that it didn't get uploaded completely. Yuutsu Na Seven Days has won the "<a href="poll.html">Which-song-to-be-available-for-download-next</a>" poll. =P So that's been uploaded as well. That poll has also been reset with new songs, so start voting for the next one! xD<br><br>
<b>11.17.2002</b>: Two new sections in the Information Centre this time, <a href="creator.html" target="_top">About the creator</a> and a <a href="dictionary.html" target="_top">Gravi dictionary</a> listing all the Gravi and shounen-ai related terms. ^_^ Finding information on Maki Murakami is extremely hard, x_x especially when she doesn't like to show her face, so there are virtually no images of her. O_o; <br><br>
<b>11.08.2002</b>: A brand new layout for the <a href="info.html" target="_top">Information Centre</a>, <a href="multi.html" target="_top">Entertainment Centre</a> as well as the updates page, as plainly seen here. xD The old ones have been up since March, so I thought it'd be a nice change. :3 The information centre features an opening shot of Tohma and Mika...why? Because their car *rocks.* xD I couldn't resist using it. :D The entertainment centre's layout features the ending shots of Shuichi and Yuki as well as the city buildings and lights. :3 Finally, the updates page features the one and only, tigger-happy, number 1 manager K! xDDD All the K images used here are courtesy of the wonderful <a href="http://time-stranger.net/k" target="_blank">Shiori-san</a>, go visit her spectacular tribute to K. >D Hope everyone likes the changes, and give me some feedback in the <a href="http://dtd.ainoyume.net/cgi-bin/guestbook.cgi" target="_blank">gbook</a>! :D<br><br>
<b>11.03.2002</b>: New index layout! :D Tohma was too yummy to pass up xD It isn't the greatest layout, but it'll do for now. There were some broken links in the music section, so I changed the URL. At any rate, they should be working now.<br><br>
<b>10.30.2002</b>: Ack, updates are getting slimmer and slimmer aren't they? O_o;; Gravi Manga Scans Track1-9 are up at <a href="http://www.cloverpetals.com/addiction" target="_blank">Addiction</a>, as well as some other images. 2 buttons have been added in the <a href="linkdtd.html" target="_top">Link DtD</a> section. xD<br><br>
<b>10.12.2002</b>: Nothing much this time, I just updated the disclaimers so there are no broken links. <.<; I keep forgetting to upload manga tracks 1-9 on Addiction, but I shall do it in the next couple of days. xD<br><br>
<b>10.03.2002</b>: Woah, long time no update. <.< This update refers to <a href="http://www.cloverpetals.com/addiction" target="_blank">Addiction</a> only. :3 New doujinshi section is up, with 28 doujinshi pictures. <3 <3 There are also some new anime and manga images, visit Addiction for the specific updates. Yes, an updates section has been added at Addiction. :3 The current image count is 3,233 images, w00t! xD<br><br>
<b>09.15.2002</b>: The TV Animation Artbook scans are up at <a href="http://www.cloverpetals.com/addiction" target="_blank">Addiction</a>. Noriko's seiyuu is up, finally.^^ I've had the information for a while, but I'd always forget to put it up. More Gravitation Manga will be up soon, up till Track 9.<br><br>
<b>09.09.2002</b>: <a href="http://www.cloverpetals.com/addiction" target="_blank">Addiction</a> went on hiatus for a day ^^;; but managed to come back very soon, with a new look and easier navigation. I'm pretty satisfied with the new look, hopefully it'll be easier for everyone else as well. New images were uploaded as well, I can't really say which ones since I don't remember <.< But they're in the anime and manga sections. XD The TV animation artbook will be up in the next few days, so look for that. :D Oh yes, Predilection, the newest Gravitation song, is available in the music section in <a href="multi.html" target="_blank">Multimedia</a>. It's from the third Sound Story, sung by Ryuichi's seiyuu himself. XDD Lyrics for Predilection are also available in the lyrics section.<br><br>
<b>08.31.2002</b>: Cosplay pics are the newest section in <a href="multi.html" target="_blank">Multimedia</a>. If you have any cosplay images, feel free to contribute! Also added 2 buttons for <a href="linkdtd.html" target="_blank">Linking DtD</a> since I really don't like my other ones.

<b>08.19.2002</b>: Dare to Dream now has a <a href="http://www.shounen-ai.org/dream/lite/" target="_blank">Lite version</a> for those of you who have a slower connection XD I have dial-up myself, so I know how much of a pain that can be. I made the Lite version very graphics lite, so hopefully it'll make a difference for people with slower connections...that way, they can still enjoy the site. :) School starts tomorrow, so updates will slim down. ><<br><br>
<b>08.15.2002</b>: The "<a href="http://www.shounen-ai.org/dream/quiz" target="_blank">Which Gravi Character are You"</a> quiz is finally up^_^ Go find out who you're most like! <br><br>
